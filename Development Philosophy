## Development Philosophy

Ether Notifier is built entirely with hand-written code and avoids the use of no-code or low-code platforms. This approach ensures:

- Full control over the logic and behavior of every component.
- Complete transparency and auditability for developers and reviewers.
- High extensibility across both Web2 and Web3 layers.
- Alignment with open-source values and long-term maintainability.

The system is developed using:
- Vyper for secure and minimalistic smart contracts.
- Python-based CLI for fast and direct developer interaction.
- FastAPI for scalable and modern HTTP interfaces (optional).

This architecture reflects a conscious commitment to technical clarity and gives developers the freedom to build, adapt, and contribute meaningfully.
